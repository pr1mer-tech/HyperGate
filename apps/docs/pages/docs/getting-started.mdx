# Getting Started

## Overview

HyperGate is a [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh)-like library to interact with [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org). It's mainly aimed to be used within React applications, but it can be used in any JavaScript environment.

A significant amount of code is borrowed from [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) themselves, so a big shoutout to them for their work.

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i hypergate
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i hypergate
```

```bash [bun]
bun i hypergate
```

## Usage

To use HyperGate, you need to wrap your application with the `HyperGateConfig` and `QueryClientProvider` components. The `HyperGateConfig` component is used to configure the HyperGate library, and the `QueryClientProvider` component is used to provide the React Query client.

```tsx twoslash
// @allowUmdGlobalAccess
// @module: esnext
// @moduleResolution: bundler
import { HyperGateConfig } from "@hypergate/react";
import { XummConnector, createConfig } from "@hypergate/core";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <HyperGateConfig
      config={createConfig({
        connectors: [
          new XummConnector(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_XUMM_API_KEY ?? ""),
        ],
      })}
    >
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
    </HyperGateConfig>
  );
}
```
